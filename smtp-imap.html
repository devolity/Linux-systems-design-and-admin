<li>Configure the system to act as the incoming MTA for the
domain.</li>

<li>Configure the system to act as the outgoing MTA for the local
network.</li>

<li>Configure the system for remote email reading.</li>

</ul>

<p><strong>Install a new system for use as an MTA:</strong>&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
<li>Create another virtual system and install the server operating
system.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Configure the system to act as the incoming MTA for the
domain:</strong>&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
<li>Configure the <code>exim4</code> software to receive email.</li>

<li>The server should accept email for users at your domain. (e.g.
<code>user@example.com</code>)</li>

<li>The server should accept email for users at any of the hosts in
your domain. (e.g. <code>user@mybox.example.com</code>)</li>

<li>The DNS should be configured to direct email for all hosts in your
domain to this system.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Configure the system to act as the outgoing MTA for the
local network:</strong>&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
<li>Configure the <code>exim4</code> software to send email.</li>

<li>Messages sent from the server should appear to come from users at
your domain. (e.g. <code>user@example.com</code>)</li>

<li>The server should relay email for users at any of the hosts in your
domain. (e.g. Email from user@mybox.example.com should be relayed to
its destination.)</li>

<li>The server should send all outgoing email through
<code>sol.cs.dixie.edu</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Configure the system for remote email
reading:</strong>&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
<li>Configure the <code>uw-imapd</code> software to provide IMAP remote
mail reading.</li>

<li>Only allow connections to IMAP through the encrypted port.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Configure the systems in the local network to relay all
email through the system:</strong>&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
<li>On each existing system, configure the <code>exim4</code> software
to use your MTA as a smarthost.</li>

<li>On each existing system, the MUAs <code>mailx</code> and
<code>mutt</code> should be installed.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Pass-off Procedure:</strong>&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
<li>Create a user on each of the systems. Use the same password for
each system.</li>

<li>Using the CIT submission system, submit a file to IT3100,
SMTP.</li>

<li>The file should be named <code>smtp_info.txt</code>. This file must
be a plain text file, with the following format: 

<pre>
mta: ip_address_of_MTA<br />
user: user_name_created_for_passoff<br />
pass: password_for_user<br />
hosts: ip_address_of_host1, ip_address_of_host2, ...<br />
domain: name.of.domain
</pre>

For example, a file may look like this: 

<pre>
mta: 144.38.212.50<br />
user: bonzai<br />
pass: $&amp;^bbi13<br />
hosts: 144.38.212.48, 144.38.212.49, 144.38.212.50<br />
domain: horgoth.com
</pre>
</li>

<li>Each of ip addresses in the <code>hosts</code> list must have a
valid reverse DNS entry!</li>

<li>Several email messages will be sent to the user at each of the
hosts listed.</li>

<li>Several email messages will be sent from the user at each of the
hosts listed.</li>

<li>Email messages that are not correctly delivered will cause points
to be deducted from the assignment.</li>
</ul>
