<p><strong>Assignment:</strong>&nbsp;<br />
Install and configure domain name server software, manage a DNS
domain.</p>

<p><strong>Requirements:</strong>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
<li>Register a domain name with the proper authorities.</li>

<li>Configure primary and secondary authoritative domain name servers
for a domain.</li>

<li>Configure primary and secondary authoritative domain name servers
for a reverse lookup zone.</li>

<li>Configure two caching lookup domain name servers.</li>

<li>Correct the hostname, domain, and DNS lookup of all systems.</li>

<li>Write a shell script to verify that DNS is working correctly.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Register a domain name with the proper
authorities:</strong>&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
<li>Decide on a domain name, check that it is not used. Repeat until a
unique domain name has been found.</li>

<li>Register your domain name with a registrar. Many can be found on
the net. See the links below. You should not pay more than $10 for this
service. Be sure to accurately fill out the contact information. You
<em>must</em> put "Curtis Larsen, 225 South 700 East, St. George UT cgl
at dixie.edu" as the technical contact.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Configure primary and secondary authoritative domain name
servers for a domain:</strong>&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
<li>On one system configure the files in <code>/etc/bind/</code> to
become the primary authoritative server for your domain.</li>

<li>On another system configure the files in <code>/etc/bind/</code> to
become the secondary authoritative server for your domain.</li>

<li>Verify that your domain name servers are working correctly.</li>

<li>Return to your registrar's configuration site and assign your 
 systems as the primary and secondary name servers (Note that
you must first register the systems as a name servers, then assign your
domain to be served by the name servers.)</li>

<li>Verify that the rest of the domain name system is correctly finding
your name server. (This may take up to 48 hours.)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Domain Configuration Details:</strong>&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
<li>Allow hosts from any IP address to lookup information about your
domain.</li>

<li>Allow your backup name servers to transfer the entire zone.</li>

<li>Automatically notify your backup servers of changes to your
zone.</li>

<li>Configure names for at least 8 of the IP addresses in your
control.</li>

<li>Configure aliases so that <code>www, ftp, sql, and mail</code>
point to hosts in your domain.</li>

<li>It is conventional to configure your name servers with the names
<code>ns1</code> and <code>ns2</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Configure primary and secondary authoritative domain name
servers for a reverse lookup zone:</strong>&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
<li>On one system configure the files in <code>/etc/bind/</code> to
become the primary authoritative for the reverse lookup of IPs in your
control. (This is the set of 16 IPs sent to you in your registration
packet.)</li>

<li>On another system configure the files in <code>/etc/bind/</code> to
become the secondary authoritative for the reverse lookup of IPs in
your control. (This is the set of 16 IPs sent to you in your
registration packet.)</li>

<li>Your reverse zone is <code>aaa-bbb.ccc.38.144.in-addr.arpa.</code>,
where <code>aaa</code> is the first number in your control, and
<code>bbb</code> is the last number in your control. <code>ccc</code>
is 210, 211, or 212 depending on your assigned numbers. For example, my
zone is <code>48-63.212.38.144.in-addr.arpa.</code>.</li>

<li>Verify that your domain name servers are working correctly.</li>

<li>Submit the full DNS names of your name servers to the reverse zone
registrar. That is the course instructor. Send the information via
email to <code>it3100</code> at <code>cs.dixie.edu</code>.</li>

<li>Verify that the rest of the domain name system is correctly finding
your name server for reverse lookup.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Domain Reverse Details:</strong>&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
<li>Allow hosts from any IP address to lookup information about your
reverse domain.</li>

<li>Allow your backup name servers to transfer the entire zone.</li>

<li>Automatically notify your backup servers of changes to your
zone.</li>

<li>Configure reverse lookup information for each of the IPs used in
your forward lookup zone. These names should match the <code>A</code>
records from the forward zone.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Configure two caching lookup domain name
servers:</strong>&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
<li>Both of your DNS servers will be used as caching lookup
servers.</li>

<li>Only allow hosts from <code>144.38.192.0/19</code> to ask for DNS
lookups.</li>

<li>Limit the cache size to 1 MByte.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Correct the hostname, domain, and DNS lookup of all
systems:</strong>&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
<li>Change the <code>/etc</code> configuration files so that the
operating system knows the correct host and domain names for your
systems.</li>

<li>Change the <code>/etc</code> configuration files so that your
systems use your DNS lookup servers first and second. As a third backup
they may use <code>144.38.192.2</code>.</li>

<li>Change the <code>/etc</code> configuration files so that your
systems use look for hosts in your domain automatically.</li>

<li>Verify that your configuration changes are working correctly.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Write a shell script to verify that DNS is working
correctly:</strong>&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
<li>Write a shell script to verify each of the functions of your DNS
servers.</li>

<li>The script file shall be named <code>check_dns.bash</code>.</li>

<li>This script should be flexible. This means driven by command line
parameters, configuration files, or configuration variables at the top
of the file.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Pass-off Procedure:</strong>&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
<li>Use the CIT submission system.</li>

<li>Submit <code>check_dns.bash</code>.</li>

<li>Submit a text file named <code>dns_info.txt</code>. This file must
be a plain text file, with the following format: 

<pre>
master: ip_address_of_master<br />
slave: ip_address_of_slave<br />
domain: name.of.domain
</pre>

For example, my file would look like this: 

<pre>
master: 144.38.212.48<br />
slave: 144.38.212.49<br />
domain: horgoth.com
</pre>
</li>
</ul>
