<p><strong>Assignment:</strong>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Often computer systems are used by several different groups of
users, with varying levels of cooperation between the groups. In this
assignment you will gain experience in creating users and groups, and
managing them.</p>

<p><strong>Requirements :</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Create the user accounts listed.</li>

<li>Create the user groups listed.</li>

<li>Add the users to groups as listed.</li>

<li>Create the new DNS domains listed.</li>

<li>Configure the MTA to handle the new domains.</li>

<li>Configure the the HTTP server to handle the new domains.</li>

<li>Configure the the HTTPS site to serve web mail access for the new
domains.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Create the user accounts listed</strong>:<br />
For each of the users listed, create an account on the web server and
an account on the email server. The users should have their own unique
default group, independent of any other group membership. For your
convenience, only the accounts that are marked need to have passwords
set. Note that this means the other accounts can not be logged into
directly.</p>

<p><strong>Create the user groups listed</strong>:<br />
For each of the groups listed, create a group on the web server.</p>

<p><strong>Add the users to groups as listed</strong>:<br />
For each user, add the user to the list of groups. Some users may be
added to more than one group.</p>

<p><strong>Create the new DNS domains listed</strong>:<br />
For each group, create a new DNS domain. The domain should be
<code>groupname.yourdomain</code>. Each of these domains should be
served from your authoratative servers. Each should have its own unique
zone file. Each should define 'A' records for 'www' and 'mail' that
point to your webserver and MTA respectively.</p>

<p><strong>Configure the MTA to handle the new domains</strong>:<br />
The MTA should be configured to accept email destined for the new
domains and their hostnames created above. DNS should be modified to
insure that all email is sent to the MTA.</p>

<p><strong>Configure the the HTTP server to handle the new
domains</strong>:<br />
For each new domain, create a new virtual host on the web server to
handle web traffic for the domain. Configure the document root for the
each new web site so that any member of the group that corresponds to
the domain can make modifications to the web site. You will probably
need to add www-data to all of the groups as well.</p>

<p><strong>Configure the the HTTPS site to serve web mail access for
the new domains</strong>:<br />
For each of the new domains, install a copy of squirrel mail so that
users can read and send mail specifically for the new domain. Install
the squirrel mail in the directory <code>sm-groupname</code> from the
document root of the secure virtual host.</p>

<p><strong>Notes</strong>:</p>

<ul>
<li>Download the <a class="text" href="http://cit.cs.dixie.edu/it/it3100/sources/users-f07.csv">user/group
file</a>.</li>

<li>There are 100 users and 10 groups. That's a lot of typing and typos
if you process this data by hand. I strongly recommend developing tools
to automate some of the processing.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Pass-off Procedure:</strong>&nbsp;<br />
Detailed pass off procedures will be posted soon.</p>
